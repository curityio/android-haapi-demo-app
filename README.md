This is an example Android app which uses the Curity Identity Server's Hypermedia API to perform an
OAuth2 flow with authentication done completely from the app, without the need of an external browser.

## Running the example

Before running the app, e.g. from Android Studio, at the top of `MainActivity.kt` set properties
which apply to your instance of the Curity Identity Server.
